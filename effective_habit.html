        <h1>The Urgency Index</h1>
        <p>According to the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, the Urgency Index is a tool to help individuals understand their mindset towards urgency and time management. It consists of 16 questions that measure how often you feel pressured by time constraints and how you handle urgent tasks.</p>
        <p>As you read each statement, select the number that best describes your response (0=Never, 2=Sometimes, 4=Always).</p>

    <h2>The Time Management Matrix</h2>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
        <tr>
            <th>Quadrant</th>
